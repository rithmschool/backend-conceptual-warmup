...in which the client has request for certain information

9. What is the difference between `redirect` and `render_template`? When would you use one or the other?

render_template is used primarly for GET requests and involves simply generating an HTML page with the relevant python information.


redirect is used for sending information back to the server with information that can
be considered when handling non-GET requests.


- What does the following code do?

```py
student = Student('Joel', 'Burton')
db.session.add(student)
db.session.commit(student)
```

A Student model with the values 'Joel' and 'Burton' is assigned to the variable 'student'.
A session is started that is required for modifying a database. Here the contents within
student is added to a database and then saved via commit.


- What does the following code do?

```py
@app.route('/students', methods=["GET", "POST"])
def index():
   if request.method == "POST":
       student = Student('Joel', 'Burton')
       db.session.add(student)
       db.session.commit(student) 
       return redirect(url_for("index"))
   return render_template("index.html", students=Student.query.all())
```

The decrorator @app.route('/students', methods=["GET", "POST"]) is used with the view
function index(). When this route is just access/read, a "GET" request is used to
render index.html with a collection of students. When a "POST" request is made,
via a form, a new student is created and add to the database. Afterwards, a redirect
is used to go back to the index view function with a GET request to generate the
index.html page that may have all the students including the new student.

- What does the following code do?

```sh
flask db init
```

The creates an 'alembic' table that is used for tracking..? 'flask db migrate'
can then be used to create tables and make a modifications. A migration folder is added
to the project that can be later referred for viewing modifications.

- What does the following code do?

```sh
flask db migrate -m "adding favorite_color column to students table"
```

This stages the changes for a database to have which should be reflected from the message.
A file is genrated in the versions folder within the migrations folder that reflects the changes that will be made/updated to show in the in area with the upgrade.  Information before the change can also be viewed in the area of the versions file that has 'downgrade'

- What does the following code do?

```sh
flask db upgrade
```

The soldifies the changes and updates the changes within the database

- Given the resource `students` - write out all 7 RESTful routes (include the HTTP verb and endpoint)

*CRUD (create read update delete considered below)

GET '/students' -> index.html reading all students

GET '/students/new -> new.html show form for creating a new student

GET '/students/<id>' -> show.html show the information for a student matching id in database

GET '/students/<id>/edit' -> edit.html show the page to edit a student

POST '/students/new' -> new.html create new student

PATCH '/students/<id>/edit' -> edit.html edit a student's info

DELETE '/students/<id>/edit' -> edit.html delete a student


- Imagine we want to add another resource for `excuses` which is a 1 to Many with `students` - write out all 7 RESTful routes that nest excuses inside of students (include the HTTP verb and endpoint)

**html files in excuses folder

GET '/students/<id>/excuses' -> index.html reading all excuses associated with a student

GET '/students/<id>/excuses/new' -> new.html show form for creating a new excuse for a student

GET '/students/<id>/excuses/<excuse_id>' -> show.html show the information for an excuse

GET '/students/<id>/excuses/<excuse_id>/edit' -> edit.html show the page to edit an excuse

POST '/students/<id>/excuses/new' -> new.html create new excuse

PATCH '/students/<id>/excuses/<excuse_id>' -> edit.html edit an excuse

DELETE '/students/<id>/excuses/<excuse_id>' -> edit.html delete a excuse
